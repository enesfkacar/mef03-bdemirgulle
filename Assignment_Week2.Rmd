## Burcu Demirg√ºlle


Glad to introduce myself as as Miss. Burcu Demirgulle. I have done secondary school at Uskudar Science High School in 2008. Conviction and natural aptitude for science and mathematics convinced me manufacturing and industrial engineering was the most fitting career for me. This belief that the education is most valuable thing for me to gain a statu in a community. It continues to be the driving forces in my pursuit of academic excellence as a senior at the Sabanci University. I desire a degree in industrial engineering not only because it is the most fulfilling way I can exercise my natural talents as a scholar, but because it also gives me the opportunity to solve challenges directly impacting my community.

## 3-Summarize my Foursquare Swarm check-ins

For this little experiment, He used the Swarm data gathered during his six days in the Lion City to visualize the places and areas he visited. Moreover, besides just visualizing the locations, he explored the dataset to find out the dominant category of the spots He visited, and the distribution of check-ins over time.
